                 -----------------------------

  CALMET accepts upper air data (wind and temperature soundings) from
  UP.DAT files, where each UP.DAT file contains data for one station.
  READ62 processes soundings from standard NCDC data formats, reports
  problems with data entries, and produces an output file in the UP.DAT
  format.  NCDC formats supported include TD-6201 and FSL.

 --- File Options ---

     Type of NCDC input sounding data file
     (JDAT)                     No Default      ! JDAT = 1 !
        1 = TD-6201 format

     (ISUB)                     Default: 0      ! ISUB = 0 !
     0 = NO substitute sounding file is used
     1 = Delimiter between data in a sounding level is a slash (/)
         and wind speed and direction are written as integers
     2 = Delimiter between data in a sounding level is a comma (,)
         and all data are written as reals (more significant digits)

     Format used in UP.DAT output data records
     (IFMT)                     Default: 2      ! IFMT = 1 !
        1 = Delimiter between data in a sounding level is a slash (/)

        2 = Delimiter between data in a sounding level is a comma (,)
            and all data are written as reals (more significant digits)

 --- Processing Options ---

     Top pressure (mb) level for which data are extracted (e.g., 850 mb,
     700 mb, 500 mb, etc.).  Pressure level must correspond to a height
     that equals or exceeds the top of the CALMET modeling domain, or
     else CALMET will stop with an error message.
     (PSTOP)                    Default: 700.   ! PSTOP = 500 !

     Missing data control options to determine when a sounding level
     is rejected, and when an incomplete sounding level is written to
     the UP.DAT file with missing value indicators.  The missing value
     indicators are:
             Height         = 9999  (9999.0)
             Temperature = 999.9
             Wind Direction = 999   (999.0)
             Wind Speed     = 999   (999.0)
     Eliminate level if at least one of the following is missing?
     (LHT)   Height             Default: F      ! LHT = F !
     (LTEMP) Temperature        Default: F      ! LTEMP = F !
     (LWD)   Wind Direction     Default: F      ! LWD = F !
     (LWS)   Wind Speed         Default: F      ! LWS = F !


     Sounding repair options to automatically fix-up certain deficiencies
     identified in the sounding data.  Any deficiencies not addressed will
     be identified in the UP.DAT output file and must be addressed by the
     user before that file can be used in CALMET.  Note that the repair
     options selected will be applied before any sounding replacement is
     done (soundings are replaced using the SUBSOUND.DAT file only if the
     ISUB variable is not zero).

     (1) Extrapolation to extend missing profile data to PSTOP pressure level?
     - Wind speed and direction are constant with height
     - Temperature gradient is constant with height
     - Valid data must exist at heights as great as PVTOP (mb) pressure level
     (LXTOP)                Default: F      ! LXTOP = F !
     (PVTOP)                Default: 850.   ! PVTOP = 850 !

     (2) Extrapolation to extend missing profile data to surface?
     - Wind  direction is constant with height
     - Wind  speed is set with first valid speed, extrapolated to 10m
       using the neutral power law
     - Valid data must exist within first ZVSFC (m) of the surface
     - Temperature is NOT extrapolated
     (LXSFC)                Default: F      ! LXSFC = F !
     (ZVSFC)                Default: 200.   ! ZVSFC = 200 !
