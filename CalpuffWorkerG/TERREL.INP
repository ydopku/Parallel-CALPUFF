                 ------------------------------------

  TERREL accepts terrain surface elevation data from a number of 
  digital data bases and forms grid-cell averages or point-values for
  use in particular dispersion modeling systems.  For the CALPUFF
  system, TERREL produces a gridded terrain file for the MAKEGEO
  processor, and it produces a file of point-values for discrete
  receptors for CALPUFF.  Use TERREL one of more times to build the 
  requested file.

     By default, no data files are expected, and running TERREL
     without input data files will allow it to complete its set-up
     procedures, and report the number of data files needed to cover
     the specified modeling domain.  This information can be helpful
     when assembling the data files for an application.

INPUT GROUP: 1 -- Processing Options
--------------

   Intermediate data for the terrain grid are saved in a binary
   file for subsequent applications of TERREL.  When TERREL is
   applied more than once (with different terrain data files), the
   save file must be used to pass previous results along.

     Previous SAVE file used to start this run?
     (LPREV)                    Default: F      ! LPREV = F !
        T = PREV.SAV file is used
        F = PREV.SAV file is NOT used


   TERREL constructs gridded terrain elevations (m MSL), and may also
   estimate the terrain elevation at discrete points by selecting the
   peak elevation within a prescribed distance (km) from each point.
   When processing discrete points, the XYINP.DAT provides the grid
   coordinates (km) of each point, and may also include a height above
   ground (m) for each point (e.g. for elevated receptors).  The
   structure of the XYINP.DAT file is a free-format text file with
   either 2 columns (X,Y) or 4 columns (X,Y,Elevation,Height).  When
   the 4-column form is used, data in the 3rd column are replaced
   with the elevations obtained from the terrain data base files.

     Report elevations for discrete (X,Y) points?
     (LXY)                      Default: F      ! LXY = F !
        T = Yes (XYINP.DAT and XYOUT.DAT files are used)
        F = No  (XYINP.DAT and XYOUT.DAT files are NOT used)

   Interpolate elevations for discrete points?
     (Used only if LXY=T)
     (LINTXY)                   Default: F      ! LINTXY = F !
     T = Yes (elevations will be interpolated)
     F = No  (elevations will be terrain peaks)

   Number of data columns in XYINP.DAT file
     (Used only if LXY=T)
     (NXYCOL)                   Default: 4      ! NXYCOL = 0 !

     Search radius (km) about each (X,Y) for locating terrain peak 
     or for carrying out interpolation
     (Used only if LXY=T)

   Some terrain data sets contain void areas where the data are
   missing.  Others may contain areas where data are inaccurate (noisy).
   Both situations occur mostly over oceans or large lakes, but for SRTM
   data it can also occur over land due to the data set still evolving.
   These void (missing) or noisy input data can be replaced in several
   ways.

   Noisy Data ---
   Noise affects SRTM data for oceans and lakes and the adjacent shores,
   due to the scattering effects of water on radar measurements.
   The most obvious occurence of noise is negative elevations for water
   and adjacent land points.  This can be filtered with the specification
   of a minimum acceptable elevation by water/land type.  Extracted
   elevations that are greater than this minimum are retained, while those
   lower than this minimum value can be re-defined as missing for
   subsequent treatment by the missing values processing, or can be
   replaced with either the minimum value or with another default value
   defined for treatment of void (missing) data.  The minimum values must
   be chosen judiciously for the region being treated since some regions
   have valid elevations below MSL.

   Missing data ---
   Cells with missing elevations can be interpolated from surrounding
   cells with valid values, and a maximum search radius is defined.
   Also, if coastline processing has been used, default elevations for
   each water/land type can be defined and used in place of voids.
   This replacement can be carried out as the final step before output
   on a cell-by-cell and receptor-by-receptor basis, or can be carried
   out for values extracted from the terrain files as missing.  This
   latter option is best used only for oceans and lakes.  For oceans
   and lakes it is also possible to not use extracted elevations but
   only use the default.

   Coastline data are used to define coarse water/land type by
   point or cell, for several of the options available for treating
   missing or noisy data.  Coarse water/land type definitions currently
   available in TERREL are:
       1 = ocean
       2 = mainland and marine islands
   Coastline data are accepted in the form of either the USGS Global
   Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Shoreline (GSHHS) Database
   file, or a BLN file produced in a previous application for the modeling
   domain (it must have correct grid limits and polygon headers).  The
   processed coastline (BLN) file for the domain is automatically created
   when the GSHHS database is input.  No BLN is created when an existing
   BLN file is input.

     Process coastline data?
     (LCOAST)                   Default: F      * LCOAST = *
       T = Process coastline data

     (IPROC)                    Default: 2      ! IPROC = 2 !
        1 = NORMAL: terrain data for point at the intersection of ring
                    and ray is extracted from the region bounded by
                    rings and radials halfway to the adjacent rings and
                    radials
        2 = SCREEN: terrain data for point at the intersection of ring
                    and ray is extracted from the region bounded by the
                    current ring and the next larger ring, and radials
                    halfway to the adjacent radials

INPUT GROUP: 3 -- Polar Grid Ring Distances (km) and Ray Angles (deg)
--------------

     Enter NRING lines identifying the radius (DISKM) of each ring in
     the polar grid, using a group terminator on each line.
     (Enter only if IGRID=3)

     * DISKM =  3.0  *   *END*


     Enter NRAYS lines identifying the angle (ANGDEG) from North of
     each radial in the polar grid, using a group terminator on each line.
     (Enter only if IGRID=3)

     * ANGDEG =  45.  *   *END*
